# CNN for Skin Cancer Detection ü©∫

This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify different types of skin cancer lesions from dermatoscopic images. The model aims to distinguish between 7 different classes of skin lesions, leveraging the power of deep learning to aid in visual diagnosis.

## Overview üìù

Skin cancer is the most common form of human malignancy. Its diagnosis is primarily visual, starting with a clinical screening and potentially followed by dermoscopic analysis and biopsy. Automating the classification of skin lesions is a challenging task due to the subtle, fine-grained variations in their appearance.

This project uses the **HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images")** dataset to train a CNN model capable of classifying skin lesions into seven distinct categories.

## The Dataset: HAM10000 üñºÔ∏è

The HAM10000 dataset is a collection of **10,015 dermatoscopic images** made available for machine learning research through the ISIC archive. It's a benchmark dataset designed for comparing machine learning models against human expert performance.

The dataset is categorized into 7 classes of skin cancer:
1.  **Melanocytic nevi** (nv)
2.  **Melanoma** (mel)
3.  **Benign keratosis-like lesions** (bkl)
4.  **Basal cell carcinoma** (bcc)
5.  **Actinic keratoses** (akiec)
6.  **Vascular lesions** (vasc)
7.  **Dermatofibroma** (df)

## Dataset Link üíæ

The dataset used for this project is the **HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images")** dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

* **Dataset:** [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)


## Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

I've followed a systematic 14-step process to build, train, and evaluate the skin cancer detection model.

**Step 1: Importing Essential Libraries**
* Loading key libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

**Step 2: Making a Dictionary of Images and Labels**
* Mapping image IDs to their respective lesion type labels.

**Step 3: Reading and Processing Data**
* Loading the metadata and preparing it for analysis.

**Step 4: Data Cleaning**
* Handling any missing or null values in the dataset.

**Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Visualizing the data distribution across different classes and features like age, sex, and lesion location.

*EDA plots here.*

**Step 6: Loading & Resizing Images**
* Loading all images from their directories and resizing them to a uniform dimension (e.g., 100x75) suitable for the CNN.

**Step 7: Train-Test Split**
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

**Step 8: Normalization**
* Scaling pixel values from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1] to help the model converge faster.

**Step 9: Label Encoding**
* Converting categorical string labels (e.g., 'mel', 'nv') into numerical format.

**Step 10: Train-Validation Split**
* Further splitting the training data into training and validation sets to monitor for overfitting during training.

**Step 11: Model Building (CNN)**
* Defining the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.

**Step 12: Setting Optimizer & Annealing**
* Choosing an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and setting up a learning rate reduction schedule (`ReduceLROnPlateau`) to adjust the learning rate based on validation accuracy.

**Step 13: Fitting the Model**
* Training the CNN on the training data for a specified number of epochs.

**Step 14: Model Evaluation**
* Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix.
